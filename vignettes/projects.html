<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>Each student will undertake an R-based final project for this class. This project could be one related to your own thesis work, which we will discuss and agree upon. Alternatively, you can choose to undertake one of the projects listed below. Some of these are individual projects, some of their you will work on as part of a team.</p>
<p>This list is currently in thumbnail form, and will fill out during the next few weeks.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-list" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Project list</h1>
<div id="port-aquacropos-to-r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Port <code>AquacropOS</code> to R</h2>
<p>Port the code for the crop simulator <code>AquacropOS</code> from matlab into R, integrating into the existing <code>rcropmod</code> package. Final project results will include running and presenting gridded crop yield simulations, based on the output of a sophisticated crop model. Skills that will be picked up on the way: matlab -&gt; R translation; <code>data.table</code>, <code>raster</code>, among others.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-defeat-gerrymandering" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Help defeat gerrymandering</h2>
<p>There are four potential projects that will help contribute to an understanding of the impacts of gerrymandering in US politics. These ideas come from Sam Wang and Brian Remlinger of the <a href="http://gerrymander.princeton.edu">Princeton Gerrymandering project</a>, with whom you would collaborate if taking up one of these projects.</p>
<p>All of these projects have the potential to make a substantial contribution to broader public understanding of gerrymandering, and may even help influence state level redistricting efforts.</p>

</ul>
<div id="voting-precinct-demography" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Voting Precinct Demography</h3>
<p>The project will assess the demographics of different voting precincts in different states, using the information contained in the polygons representing voting precincts and US census blocks. The final desired result is an R package that has reusable code that can be used to process any of the varying precinct data available from different states, intersect these with census blocks, and produce demographic metrics from these.</p>

<div id="districting-and-population-visualizations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Districting and Population Visualizations</h3>
<p>The goal is to demonstrate how redistricters gerrymander congressional districts by “packing” or “cracking” high population areas. Background on the issue can be seen in this LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-wang-remlinger-gerrymandering-20170505-story.html">article</a>, in which the graphics were mostly made with R with some Adode Illustrator post-hoc manipulations done by the newspaper. What we would really like to do is represented by the purple-yellow scale map of North Carolina <a href="http://gerrymander.princeton.edu/info">here</a>, which didn’t make the article, but was done to support it. The goal is to create a package that can:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Take population data from a given year, and congressional district boundary polygons from a corresponding year</li>
<li>Convert them quickly and efficiently into similar maps</li>
<li>Create the package so that it installs and demos with data from North Carolina (all available years), and, depending on data availability, possibly one or two other states (e.g. Pennsylvania).</li>
<li>Additionally, if the same package can also create maps that, together with the population density information, show which party won the district, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/03/magazine/03gerrymandering_map/03gerrymandering_map-superJumbo.gif">as in this visualization</a>, that would be even better.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Skills learned: <code>rgeos</code>, <code>sf</code>, <code>sp</code>, <code>raster</code>, cleaning polygon topologies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="gis-arguments-against-compactnessmap-metrics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> GIS Arguments against Compactness/Map Metrics</h3>
<p>There is a strong perception that gerrymandering can be foiled by GIS techniques, using things such as a compactness metric (e.g. perimeter/area ratio) as a standard to prove or prevent gerrymandering. However, such standards cannot be applied in law. One reason has to do with how perimeters are measured. That requires GIS, yet the scale and density with which the polygon defining a district has a large impact on perimeter values. The goal here would be to write an R package to demonstrate and visualize how such variations in polygon delineation can impact perimeter:area ratios. This could be done quite simply with the creation of toy polygons and the use of introduced errors into node x,y coordinates. If successful and compelling, it could have an important impact on policy.</p>

<div id="analying-sensor-and-sms-survey-data-zambia" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Analying sensor and SMS survey data Zambia</h2>
<p>We have a <a href="https://twitter.com/natashakre/status/899956707119558656">network</a> of 60 <a href="https://www.arable.com">Arable Mark</a> environmental sensors currently deployed in Zambia. We also have over 1000 farmers enrolled in a weekly SMS survey that asks 12 questions related to agricultural management, local weather, and food security during the course of the growing season. The sensor network is fairly new (the majority deployed in August, 2017), but we have rainfall data collected by 7 pods from from October, 2016 up through March, 2017. The farmer surveys have been running for three seasons now in the Southern Province of Zambia, and one season across the whole country.</p>
<p>There are a variety of potential projects related to these datasets:</p>
<div id="quantify-zambias-maize-planting-season" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Quantify Zambia’s maize planting season</h3>
<p>Use the SMS data to analyze the start and end of the maize planting season and how that varies across Zambia, for the 2016-2017 growing season. How long was the season from planting to harvest? What was the average start date, and how did it vary throughout the country? What was the average harvest date, and how did it vary throughout the country?</p>
</div>
<div id="develop-a-rainfall-onset-metric" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Develop a rainfall onset metric</h3>
<p>Apply and evaluate various objective rainfall onset metrics, using data from the sensors, the SMS survey, and gridded rainfall products. Can a measure applied just to farmer SMS survey responses (e.g. change point detection) produce a similar answer date compared to a metric derived from continuous rainfall measurements from the sensors or gridded rainfall products (e.g. first three consecutive days of rain)?</p>
</div>
<div id="quantify-the-spatial-variability-of-rainfall" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Quantify the spatial variability of rainfall</h3>
<p>Use geostatistics to see what the farmers’ SMS survey rainfall responses and 2016-2017 sensor data can tell us about the spatial variability of rainfall, at weekly and daily timesteps. How much does rainfall vary between two (or more) different points at a 5, 10, or 25 km scale (the typical pixel size of the gridded rainfall products we use)?</p>
</div>
<div id="develop-a-mid-season-agricultural-drought-metric" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Develop a mid-season agricultural drought metric</h3>
<p>Use the SMS survey and co-located sensor rainfall data to identify mid-season dry-spells of potential agricultural significance. For example, two or more consecutive rainless weeks close to maize flowering or grain-filling times. Can you detect a signficant drop in farmers’ anticipated harvest amounts around such events (we might expect a sudden drop in expected harvest amounts)? How about a significant change in the rate of reduction in farmers’ reported maize storage levels fall (if farmers are concerned about crop loss, they might slow their rate of consumption of stored food)?</p>
</div>
<div id="evaluate-the-skill-of-gridded-weather-products" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Evaluate the skill of gridded weather products</h3>
<p>Compare the incoming shortwave solar radiation, temperature, and other variables measured by our new sensor pod network to comparable remotely sensed datasets. How well do the various temperature measures correlate with MODIS’s Land Surface Temperature (LST)? Is MODIS LST good enough for measuring daily air temperatures at fine scales? How well do the sensors’ incoming shortwave radiation correlate with gridded solar radiation datasets (e.g. NASA Power)?</p>
</div>
<div id="predicting-farmers-reported-yields" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.6</span> Predicting farmers’ reported yields</h3>
<p>The farmers’ report their harvests at the end of the SMS survey. Can we use their own reports of rainfall, and other more quantitative estimates of rainfall (and other weather variables), to predict those yields? If we can model that with some skill, and if the variables that are the strongest predictors of yields are variables from earlier in the season, then we might be able to use that information to forecast yields.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-farming-communities-vary-their-planting-dates-to-adapt-to-rainfall-uncertainty" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.7</span> Do farming communities vary their planting dates to adapt to rainfall uncertainty?</h3>
<p>Put another way, do farming communities in areas with higher rainfall variability show higher variability between farmers in terms of when crops are planted? We hypothesize that this might be the case, as it might be a community-level adaptive response for dealing with climatic uncertainty.</p>
<p>This would (or could be) a two-level analysis undertaken by two people. One person looks at this question by querying the SMS surveys across Zambia, looking at the local variability in the survey response to the question “did you plant crops this week”, and comparing that to measures of interannual variability derived from the gridded rainfall products (e.g. variability in onset date; variability in amount of rain each year, etc). The second person will look at that on a larger scale, using gridded cropland data, satellite-derived NDVI, and gridded precipitation data to 1) identify local variability in green-up dates in cropland areas over a larger region (maybe all of SSA); 2) compare this to the same rainfall variability metrics, as calculated for that larger region.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Using UAS to detect the spread of a crop disease</h2>
<p>We (Peter Oudemans, a Rutgers colleague, several Princeton students, and me) used a UAS to fly multiple missions over cranberry bogs in New Jersey, flying every few weeks in the summer to map the progression of a fungal disease called “Fairy Ring” that calls cranberry plants in outwards-spreading circles. We corrected the imagery very carefully so that it aligned date-on-date with high spatial precision, and want to perform analysis to see if we can check the difference in the rate of spread of the disease between blocks representing different fungicidal treatments. Initial results (from analyses performed in R) show that we can detect differences, using the object-oriented classification from the <code>EBImage</code> package (the code is already worked out), but we now have to build on this initial analysis</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be done is the analysis has to be redone for some new imagery and another area that didn’t get included in the last analysis. This means taking the existing approach, and redoing it to apply to a new set of images, and to expand the area that we are focusing on.</p>
<p>The second thing that needs doing is to add another analysis in, which is an accuracy assessment of the object-oriented classifications themselves (how accurately do they discriminate fairy ring infected areas healthy plants). We now have a ground-truth dataset that provides this information, so we have to evaluate each of the 9 images in the time series.</p>
<p>A final thing that could be done, and which might be most challenging, is to implement Hough Circle detection (a basic computer vision algorithm) in R and see whether that improves classification accuracy. Fairy ring generally presents as a circular feature, so it might be better recognized that way. There are several computer vision packages in R that make use of OpenCV, so implementing one of these to run circle detection on the cranberry imagery is the initial goal. The ultimate goal is to see whether it improves on the existing <code>EBimage</code>-based classification routine.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> An R library for running Terrset</h2>
<p>Write an R package that contains wrapper functions that allow you to run certain Terrset functions from R. This would make a valuable contribution to Clark’s flagship geospatial software, and could put Terrset on track to join ArcGIS, QGIS, GRASS, SAGA-GIS, and other GIS that have their own R packages.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> How well do crowdsourcers map individual fields?</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://mappingafrica.princeton.edu">Mapping Africa</a> project that uses a crowdsourcing platform to digitize cropland visible in high resolution satellite imagery, working within assigned mapping units of 1 km<sup>2</sup>. Our initial production run of the platform (run in the summer of 2016) mapped roughly 30,000 km<sup>2</sup> over Sub-Saharan Africa. Of particular interest are roughly 200 km<sup>2</sup> where we had at least 20 different workers map each of the sites. A subset of fields within each site were mapped on the ground using GPS. Now, for each of the fields that we mapped on the ground, we need to assess how many crowdsourced workers digitized that particular field and how many missed it. For any worker-mapped fields that intersect the ground-mapped field, we also need to assess 1) the summary statistics of intersecting worker fields (i.e. the mean worker-mapped field size, the standard deviation, 95th percentile, etc), evaluate 2) the summary statistics of omission (percent overlap) and commission (percent of workers’ maps that fell outside of the GPS-mapped field) error of the worker-mapped fields.</p>
<p>This exercise will involve extensive work with vector data. The results will give us important information about how reliable the crowdsourcing data are for understanding the characteristics of cropland throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
