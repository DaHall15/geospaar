```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Class Overview

- By the end of this class, you should:
    - Be comfortable in working with R, including most common geospatial functions
    - Have a good sense of where R is headed as a language
    - Know where to look when don't know how to do something
    - Be:
        - Using R as part of a ___reproducible___ workflow
        - __OR__ at least be sold on the tenets of reproducibility

- Course approach
    - Flipped model and emphasis on problem solving
        - Programming should be fun! (or at least intriguing)
    - Classroom and office hours as help sessions

## Reproducibility 1

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/class1_1.png")
```

## Reproducibility 2
```{r, out.width = "55%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/class1_2.png")
```
