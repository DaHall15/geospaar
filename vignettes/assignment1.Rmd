# Assignment 1 

## What you have to do:

1. On your local machine (the one that you are going to use for work outside of the classroom): 

    + Create your first R package named xyza1, where xyz is replaced by your initials (if you have more or less than 3 initials, replace xyz be the necessary number of initials).
    + The package should have just a single function in it, the same one as in [Hillary Parker's short package tutorial](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/). Note, however, that the package is not named the same. You should document the function per the tutorial.
    + Work within the RStudio environment to make this package, meaning that you have an RStudio project associated with this, as well as a local git repo. 
    + There are multiple ways you could go about making this library. You could follow and adapt Hillary Parker's tutorial. There is also another, perhaps easier, way you can set up the package and git repo in one go through Rstudio. We'll leave it to you.  
    
2. Set up a private GitHub repository under your own GitHub sub-team (your name under the [agroimpacts/geog246346](https://github.com/orgs/agroimpacts/teams/geog246346/teams) team) that has the same name as this repo. Do not initialize it with a readme, because you want to populate this GitHub repo with your local git repo. There are instructions on how to do this during the repo creation process on GitHub. 

3. Create vignettes for the package: 

    + Document the steps you took to do 1 and 2 in a vignette that is part of your xyza1 package. Call this vignette "setup". That means we want to see a descriptive HTML vignette that we can browse to understand the steps you took to make the package, and to get it under version control on GitHub. The `geospaar` package may prove to be a useful resources for this. 
    + Create a second vignette that demonstrates the use of the `cat_function`, showing the results of both the TRUE and FALSE cases. 
    
## Submission:

To complete the assignment, you have to make your final git commit and push it to the GitHub remote repo by the deadline on ___Friday September 8th (midnight)__. 

# Notes

The readings for Classes 1-3 should provide enough information for you to complete this assignment.
