## Class Overview

- *By the end of this class, you should:*
    - Be comfortable in working with R, including most common geospatial functions
    - Have a good sense of where R is headed as a language
    - Know where to look when don't know how to do something
    - Be using R as part of a ___reproducible___ workflow

- Course approach
    - (Largely) flipped model and emphasis on problem solving
        - Programming should be fun! (or at least intriguing)
    - Lab and office hours as help sessions
---

## Reproducibility

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_reproducibility.png")
```

## Overview of R
### History of R
If we go back, R is actually an implementation of S language.

- *1976*: John Chambers created S as the very first interactive and easily extensible data analysis programming language at Bell Labs. The primary version of S was implemented as Fortran libraries.
- *1988*: S was rewritten in C and was ensemble the system that we have today and was known as S3. 
- *1998*: The latest version of the S standard "S4" was released. It provides advanced object-oriented features.
- *After then*: S got some complex history, and survive.

## Overview of R
### History of R
R is a relatively young language:

- *1992*: **R**obert Gentleman and **R**oss Ihaka started to develop R as a research project.
- *1995*: Convinced by Martin Maechler, R became open-source software under GPL2 license.
- *1997 - 2000*: A critical stage for early development, including R core group, CRAN, and r-project.org. 
- *2000*: R 1.0.0 was released at February 29.

---

## Next class

- RStudio and R markdown.
- Fundamentals of R (data types and structures, and basic operations).
- With the highlight of coding style in R.
---

## Homework

- **Read** Unit1-Module 1 before section 3.2.1, section 1.7 Style in Syllabus, and cheatsheet of RStudio and R markdown.
- Get yourself a GitHub account, if you haven't
- Send us your GitHub name (**!!**)
- Install all necessary software on your local computer(s).
- Set up your [personal access token](`r here::here("vignettes/git-github.html")`)
- Go to our GitHub group page [agroimpacts](https://github.com/agroimpacts) and get yourself familiar with it (Repositories, People, Teams, etc.)
