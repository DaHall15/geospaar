## We have learned

- Setting up work tools and GitHub
- Overview of R
- R system

Any questions so far?
---

## Today

- R markdown.
- Fundamentals of R (data types and objects, and basic operations).
- With the highlight of coding style in R.

---

## R markdown

Why R markdown?

- Integrate R code directly into writing using markdown syntax with an accessible learning curve
- Reproducibility
- Plenty output formats

---

## R markdown

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class2_markdown.png")
```

---

## R markdown
### Syntax

Let's run a demo together to learn the syntax.

More details can go [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html).

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Common objects

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class2_objects.png")
```

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Data types

There are 6 atomic data types (or we could say classes of objects):
- character
  e.g. `'hello world'`, `'abc'`
- double (real or decimal)
  e.g. `10`, `3.14`, `1e10`
- integer
  e.g. `1L`
- logical
  e.g. `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `T`, `F`
- complex
  e.g. `1 + 3i` (not commonly used by us)
- *raw* (rarely used by us)

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Other special data types

- `NULL`: means not exist
- Missing data: `NA`. It is a special logical type, but can be convert to the specific type automatically when it is used with other data types.
- Infinity: `Inf` (e.g. `1 / 0`) and `-Inf` (e.g. `-1 / 0`. They are special double type.
- Undefined value: `NaN`. It is also a special double type. (e.g. `0 / 0`)

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Other special data types

- Date: `as.Date('1970-1-5')`
- Time: `as.POSIXct('1970-1-5')`
- Factor: factor could be treated as integers with labels for categorical data. Function `levels(f)` can get these labels.

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Data type checking

- `typeof(x)`
- `is.xxx(x)`: 

  * e.g. `is.double(x)`, `is.integer(x)`, `is.logical(x)`, `is.character(x)`, `is.complex(x)`, `is.raw(x)`, `is.factor`
  
  * `is.numeric(x)` exams that objects behave like numbers.
  
  * e.g. `is.na(y)`, `is.nan(y)`, `is.null(y)`, `is.infinite(y)`, `is.finite(y)`.

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Dat type converting

- `as.xxx(x)`:

  * e.g. `as.numeric(x)`, `as.double(x)`, `as.character(x)`, `as.integer(x)`, `as.logical(x)`, `as.complex(x)`, `as.raw(x)`, `as.factor(x)`, `as.Date(x)`, `as.POSIXct(x)`.
  
- logical < integer < double < character

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Vectors
- Atomic vectors (usually refer to vector):

  * A vector is a sequence of objects of the **same class**.
  * Arrays and matrices are special type of vectors with dimensions.
  
      - Matrices have 3 dimensions.
      - Arrays could have higher dimensions.

- Lists

  * Superficially for users, a list can contain objects of **different classes**.
  * Like vectors, a list can also be converted to list-matrix or list-array by defining dimensions.
  * `data.frame` and `tibble` are two S3 object-oriented objects that are created upon `list` for tabular data.

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Vectors

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class2_vector.png")
```

---

## Fundamentals of R
### Creation

  * Function `vector(mode, length)` can be used to initialize a vector of specific data type with defined length.
  * More commonly, function `c` (short for concatenate) can be used to create vectors.
  * `cbind` and `rbind` are functions can bind `vector`s to a `matrix`. Function `matrix(data_vector, nrow, ncol)` also can be used to create a matrix, and `array(data_vector, dim)` for array.
  * Anything can feed in function `list` to create a list, the same as `data.frame`.
  * `is.xxx(x)` and `as.xxx(x)` also works for vector, matrix, array, list, and data.frame.

## Fundamentals of R
### Atrributes

Any objects have attributes. If nothing is set, the attributes of an object is `NULL`. Some common attributes include:

- `names`/`dimnames`/`rownames`/`colnames`
- Overall `length`, and more specifically `dim` for matrix and array. Resetting `dim` attribute can convert a vector to matrix/array or reconstruct a matrix/array. 
- `class`: it is a bit different from function `class`.
- function `attr(object, attr_name)` can be used to query or set an attribute of an object. 
- function `attributes(x)` can be used to get all attributes of an object.
- function `str(object)` will print out a nice overview of an object.

## Practice

Let's run a R markdown practice and overview what we learned today.

[Expected output](https://agroimpacts.github.io/geospaar/class2_practice.html)

---

## Next class

- Basic control structure.
- Functions and packages.
- Object-oriented programming in R.
- Environment and scoping in R.
- Reproducibility (Package, Version control, GitHub)

---

## Homework

- Finish the practice if you didn't yet and share your HTML in our slack channel before next class.
- Read the rest of Unit1-Module1 and Unit1-Module2.
