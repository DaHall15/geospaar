knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

- An example set of slides for final class presentations 
- With demo for displays of code the executes when knitting
- And for code that displays results of code that executes offline 

## Results from code executing at knit-time
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(geospaar)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)

data("dem")
dists <- read_sf(system.file("extdata/districts.shp", package = "geospaar"))
```

## Results from executed code, plotted

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
plot_noaxes(dem)
plot(st_geometry(dists), add = TRUE)
```

 
## Results from "offline" code

Code chunk that does the analysis but saves results (in this case a png)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(geospaar)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
data("zamprec")
dists <- read_sf(system.file("extdata/districts.shp", package = "geospaar"))
mymean <- function(x, na.rm = na.rm) mean(x, na.rm = na.rm)
rfmu <- raster::extract(zamprec, dists, fun = mymean, na.rm = TRUE)
dists <- dists %>% dplyr::mutate(rain = rfmu)

# use png to save plot on disk with plot.sf
png(filename = here::here("external/slides/figures/demo_rain_sf.png"), 
    height = 4, width = 4, res = 300, units = "in")
plot(dists["rain"], main = NULL)
dev.off()

# use ggsave with ggplot figures
p <- ggplot(dists) + geom_sf(aes(fill = rain)) + theme_linedraw()
ggsave(p, filename = here::here("external/slides/figures/demo_rain_gg.png"), 
       height = 4, width = 4, dpi = 300)
```

## Results from offline code, plotted 1
`plot.sf` version (hint: look at the .Rmd to see the hidden code that plots this)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/slides/figures/demo_rain_sf.png"))
```

## Results from offline code, plotted 2
`ggplot` version 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/slides/figures/demo_rain_gg.png"))
```

## Save analytical results "offline" 
To use in downstream chunk. Good for cases where analysis takes a long time to execute

Here is the offline analysis (code chunk set to `eval=FALSE`)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tri <- raster::terrain(dem, opt = "TRI")
save(tri, file = here::here("external/slides/output/tri.rda"))
```

## Plot saved results in live chunk

After the long analysis runs and saves the results, you can read it back in to a "live" chunk (one that executes at knit-time) and do something with it.
```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
load(here::here("external/slides/output/tri.rda"))
plot_noaxes(tri, main = "Topographic Ruggedness Index")
```

## Final words

- The examples above apply to both vignettes and slides
- You can choose ioslides or slidy versions of the presentations
- Both versions are offered in RMarkdown presentation templates (see File > New File > R Markdown > Presentation)
- This example uses slidy
