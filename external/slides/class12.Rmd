## Data
- Create three matrices, `m1`, `m2`, `m3`
  - `m1`: 
      - Random number seed: `set.seed(100)`
      - `V1` = 1:20
      - `V2` 20 random numbers from 1:100
      - `V3` 20 numbers from `rnorm`, mean = 500, sd = 100)
  - `m2`: Same variables, but `set.seed(200)`
  - `m3`: Same variables, but `set.seed(300)`
- Create vector `v`: 20 random draws from `LETTERS[1:5]`; `set.seed(1)`
- Create 2 `data.frame`s: `dat1` (`m1` & `v`), `dat2` (`m2` & `v`)
  - Name the column holding `v` "GRP"
- Create list `l` combining `m1`, `m2`, `m3`, `dat1`, `dat2`, `v`
  - Name the list elements the same as the object name.

---

```{r}
set.seed(100)
m1 <- cbind(V1 = 1:20, V2 = sample(1:100, size = 20, replace = TRUE), 
            V3 = rnorm(n = 20, mean = 500, sd = 100))
set.seed(200)
m2 <- cbind(V1 = 1:20, V2 = sample(1:100, size = 20, replace = TRUE), 
            V3 = rnorm(n = 20, mean = 500, sd = 100))
set.seed(300)
m3 <- cbind(V1 = 1:20, V2 = sample(1:100, size = 20, replace = TRUE), 
            V3 = rnorm(n = 20, mean = 500, sd = 100))
set.seed(1)
v <- sample(LETTERS[1:5], size = 20, replace = TRUE)
dat1 <- data.frame(m1, "GRP" = v)
dat2 <- data.frame(m2, "GRP" = v)
l <- list(m1, m2, m3, dat1, dat2, v)
names(l) <- c("m1", "m2", "m3", "dat1", "dat2", "v")
```

### Looping practice

---

- Write a `for` loop that iterates through the vector 1:10 and prints the iterator `i` multiplied by 10
- Do the same, but instead of print `i * 10`, catch the result in a predefined empty list `o`
- Do the same as above, but use an `lapply` that assigns output to `o`
- Do the same as above, but use `sapply` instead of `lapply`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for(i in 1:10) print(i * 10)

o <- list()
for(i in 1:10) o[[i]] <- i * 10

o <- lapply(1:10, function(x) x * 10)
o <- sapply(1:10, function(x) x * 10)
```

```

## Practical
### Part 1
- read in the three `geospaar` FAO datasets into a list using `lapply`
- Reshape each of the three datasets by using `pivot_wider` to put harvested area into a new variable **harv_area** and production into **prod**, with the other variables being **crop**, **country**, and **year**. Necessary functions: `%>%`, `select`, `pivot_wider`, `rename`. 
- Combine all these into a single data.frame `crops_df`
- Best: the previous two points using `lapply` and `do.call(rbind)`
- Okay: Do this separately for each dataset and then combine with `rbind`


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(geospaar)
fs <- dir(system.file("extdata/", package = "geospaar"), 
          pattern = "FAOSTAT", full.names = TRUE)
crops <- lapply(fs, readr::read_csv)
crops_df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(crops, function(x) {
  x %>% dplyr::select(Item, Area, Element, Year, Value) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = Element, values_from = Value) %>% 
    rename(crop = Item, country = Area, year = Year, 
           harv_area = `Area harvested`, prod = Production)
}))
crops_df
```


---
### Part 2
- Create (`mutate`) a new column *yield*
- Calculate the mean of production & yield for each crop (`dplyr`)
- Calculate the mean of production & yield for each crop by country (`dplyr`)
- Advanced 1: do this with `sapply` as well as `dplyr`
- Advanced 2:`arrange` mean yield by *crop* and *country* in ascending order

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
crops_df <- crops_df %>% mutate(yield = prod / harv_area)
crops_df %>% group_by(crop) %>% 
  summarize(prod = mean(prod), yield = mean(yield))
crops_df %>% group_by(crop) %>% select(prod, yield) %>% 
  summarize_all(funs(mean))

crops_df %>% group_by(crop, country) %>% select(prod, yield) %>% 
  summarize_all(funs(mean)) %>% ungroup %>% 
  arrange(crop, yield)

sapply(c("Maize", "Sorghum", "Wheat"), function(x) {
  c(mean(crops_df[crops_df$crop == x, ]$prod), 
    mean(crops_df[crops_df$crop == x, ]$yield))
})
sapply(c("Maize", "Sorghum", "Wheat"), function(x) {
  sapply(c("South Africa", "Zambia"), function(y) {
    c(mean(crops_df[crops_df$crop == x & crops_df$country == y, ]$prod), 
      mean(crops_df[crops_df$crop == x & crops_df$country == y, ]$yield))
  })
})
sapply(c("Maize", "Sorghum", "Wheat"), function(x) {
  sapply(c("South Africa", "Zambia"), function(y) {
    d <- crops_df[crops_df$crop == x & crops_df$country == y, ]
  })
})

```

---
### Part 3
- Using `ggplot2`, make a line plot of the annual maize production by country, using red for Zambia and blue for South Africa
- Using `ggplot2`, plot a histogram of maize yields for Zambia (blue fill, grey outline)
- Advanced 1: Do the same for yields, but with base plots
- Advanced 2: use `ggplot2` to make three side-by-side line plots of production for all three crops by country (red for Zambia, blue South Africa). Do the same but for yield. You need `facet_grid` for this. 
- Advanced 3: as above, but with histograms. Side by side histogram bars for each country (`position = "dodge"`)

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(crops_df) + # %>% #filter(crop == "Maize")) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = prod / harv_area, color = country)) + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(crop)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
ggplot(crops_df %>% filter(crop == "Maize" & country == "Zambia")) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = prod), bins = 20, fill = "blue", col = "grey")

# advanced
plot(yield ~ year, 
     data = crops_df[crops_df$crop == "Maize" & 
                       crops_df$country == "South Africa", ], type = "l", 
     col = "blue", ylim = c(0, 7))
lines(yield ~ year, 
      data = crops_df[crops_df$crop == "Maize" & 
                        crops_df$country == "Zambia", ], col = "red")

ggplot(crops_df) + # %>% #filter(crop == "Maize")) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = prod / harv_area, color = country)) + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(crop)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
ggplot(crops_df) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = prod / harv_area, fill = country), bins = 20,  
                 col = "grey", position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(crop)) + xlab("Yield (t / ha)") + 
  theme_bw()

```
