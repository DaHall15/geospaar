## We have learned

- Overview of R
- R markdown
- Data types and objects, and basic operations
- Coding style

Any questions?

---

## Today

- Basic control structure.
- Functions and scoping.
- Packages and environments.
- Object-oriented programming in R.
- Reproducibility (Package, Version control, GitHub)

---

## Control structure

Commonly used control structure:

- `if` and `else`, which test a condition and do things correspondingly.
- `switch`, which branches 
- `for`, which execute a loop for a specific number of times.
- `while`, which execute a loop when a condition is true.
- `repeat`, which execute a repeat work until break out the loop.
- `break`, which can control to exit a loop.
-  `next`, which can skip an iteration of a loop.

**Note**: we will learn later and then mainly use native R loop functions `*apply` for loops.
---

## Control structure
### `if` - `else`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# one line
if (4 > 5) print('4 is larger than 5.') else print("4 is smaller than 5.")

# paragraph
if (4 > 5) {
  print('4 is larger than 5.')
} else print("4 is smaller than 5.")

# or could get longer
if (4 > 5) {
  print('4 is larger than 5.')
} else if (4 == 5){
  print("4 is equal to 5.")
} else {
  print("4 is smaller than 5.")
}

# ifelse
ifelse(4 > 5, print('4 is larger than 5.'), print("4 is smaller than 5."))
x <- 4
y <- 10
z <- ifelse(x > y, x, y)
```

---

## Control structure
### `for`

```{r, eval=F}
for (i in 1:10) print(i)
for (i in 1:10){
  print(i)
  print(i + 1)
}

# nested for
for (i in 1:10){
  for (j in 2:11){
    print(x + y)
  }
}
```

---

## Control structure
### `while` and `repeat`

```{r, eval=F}
# while
x <- 0
while(x < 10){
  print(x)
  x <- x + 1
}

# repeat
x <- 0
repeat{
  print(x)
  x <- x + 1
  if (x == 10){
    print('Finish repeat!')
    break
  }
}
```

---

## Control structure
### `break` and `next`

```{r, eval=F}
x <- 0
repeat{
  x <- x + 1 # what if we move this line after the ifs?
  if (x < 5){
    print('Skip this interation!')
    next
  }
  if (x == 10){
    print('Finish repeat!')
    break
  }
  print(x)
}
```

---

## Functions

Invoking a function is straightforward, just type the function name and give it the necessary parameters.
```{r, eval=F}
sum(1, 3)

# Assign the result to an object
x <- sum(1, 3) 

is.vector(x)

# open the help document using ?+function_name
?sum
```

---

## Functions
### Components

```{r, eval=F}
function_name <- function(arg1, arg2 = 1:10, arg3 = TRUE){
  body
}
```

Three essential components of a function:
- `formals()`, which is a list of arguments. A function could have NULL formals.
- `body()`, the code in the function. R function will return the last thing generated by the function body automatically. If you want to return something else, use `return(x)`.
- `environment()`, where the function finds the values. It might change based on where the function is defined.

Except primitive functions, which are written in C in base package. E.g. `sum`.

A function does not have to have a name. When a function has no name, it is called anonymous function. 
---

## Practice

 - Define a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.

$$Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8$$

- Exam a sequence of temperature in Fahrenheit `c(70, 34, 25, 10, 89, 92, 15)`, when the temperature in Celsius is lower than -10, give a warning "Stay inside." and print out this temperature in Celsius.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Define the function
c_to_f <- function(fah = 0){
  
}

# Initialize the temperature vector
fahs <- c(70, 34, 25, 10, 89, 92, 15)

# Loop over the temperature to check
for (fah in fahs){
  
}
```

The result should be:

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
# Define the function
c_to_f <- function(fah = 0){
  # This is a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
  # The argument is fah with a default value 0.
  (fah - 32) / 1.8
}

# Initialize the temperature vector
fahs <- c(70, 34, 25, 10, 89, 92, 15)

# Loop over the temperature to check
for (fah in fahs){
  cel <- c_to_f(fah)
  if (cel < -10){
    print('Stay inside.')
    print(cel)
  }
}
```

---

## Practice

```{r}
c_to_f <- function(fah = 0){
  # returns the the temperature in Celsius 
  # when get a value in Fahrenheit
  # Example: c_to_f(25)
  (fah - 32) / 1.8
}
fahs <- c(70, 34, 25, 10, 89, 92, 15)
for (fah in fahs){
  cel <- c_to_f(fah)
  if (cel < -10){
    print('Stay inside.')
    print(cel)
  }
}
```

**Note:** it is always a good manner to add description block within the function.

---

## Lexical scoping

Let's guess some results:
```{r, eval=F}
# Name masking
x <- 10
f1 <- function() {
  x <- 1
  x <- x + 1
  print(x)
}
f1()

# Fresh start
f1()
```

---

```{r, eval=F}
# Search level up
x <- 10
f1 <- function() {
  y <- 12
  f2 <- function(){
    z <- 14
    print(x + y + z)
  }
  f2()
}
f1()

# What about this?
x <- 10
f1 <- function(x) {
  print(x)
}
f1()
```

---

## Packages
### Usage

Installation

```{r, eval=F}
# CRAN package
install.packages('package_name')

# Non-CRAN package, e.g. GitHub, devtools
devtools::install_github('repo')

# Non-CRAN package, e.g. GitHub, remotes
remotes::install_github('tidyverse/dplyr')
```

Using

```{r, eval=F}
# Load package into working directory
library(remotes)
install_github('tidyverse/dplyr')

# Specify namespace using ::
remotes::install_github('tidyverse/dplyr')
```

---

## Environment and namespace

```{r, out.width = "45%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class3_env_nsp.png")
```

---

## Strategies to deal with conflicts

- Based on the above figure, the most efficient way is to load the package with the function you want to use later.

- We also could specify the package by using `package_name::function_name()`. It is slightly slower.

- Other recent packages to deal with conflicts if you are interested in, e.g. `import`, and `conflicted`.

---

## Reproducibility
### Build your own package and R project

Let's run a demo.

---

## `git`/GitHub

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "kevintshoemaker.github.io/StatsChats/GIT_tutorial"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/StatsChats/GIT1.png")
```

---

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "kevintshoemaker.github.io/StatsChats/GIT_tutorial"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/StatsChats/GIT2.png")
```
